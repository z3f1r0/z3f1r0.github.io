# Welcome to my blog!
> #### *As the West wind, sometimes I am like a gentle breeze and sometimes I am like an heavy storm!*

Hi! This is my first post on a blog built with [jekyll TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) by **kitian616**. A very nice, powerful and customizable theme to build personal sites and blogs! I suggest it to web passionate to try it.
I'd like to start writing about my passion in computers and in cybersecurity particularly.

### Where I can start?
I have to practice with markdown syntax. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) I found a very useful guide and I have to write a lot in order to memorize every special format.
In this moment I am writing on https://stackedit.io, a wonderful online editor for markdown.
