The term "cyber" has a fascinating history that spans various languages and disciplines over time.

This term finds its roots in the *Sanskrit* word "*kubara*," which means "*rudder*" or "*helm*", from which derives the Greek term "*kubernetes*," which means "*helmsman*" or "*governor*" and its relative verb "*kubernao*" i.e. "*hold the helm of a ship*", "*to govern*". Moreover Plato will also extend the term to the leadership of peoples: the art of governing. 

Later, in the first half of 1800, the physicist **André-Marie Ampère** 
worked on "*cybernétique*" refers to his studies on feedback mechanisms and self-regulating systems.

This concept was then adopted in scientific Latin as "**cybernetics**" by **Norbert Wiener** in 1948, defining the science of control and communication in animals and machines. Wiener used the term "cybernetics" to refer to the study of control systems, feedback, and communication in both machines and living organisms.

During the mid-20th century, the term "cybernetics" gained prominence in scientific circles, focusing on the study of complex systems and their control mechanisms. However, the popularization of the term "cyber" began in the 1980s with the rise of computer technology and cyberpunk culture.
It became associated with concepts like "**cyberspace**," a term coined by science fiction author **William Gibson** in his novel "Neuromancer" (1984),  referring to the interconnected digital environment. The prefix "cyber" expanded to describe anything related to computers, virtual reality, and the current digital landscape.

Today, "cyber" has become a ubiquitous prefix, used in various contexts, including cybersecurity, cyberspace, cybernetics, and cyberculture, signifying anything related to the digital realm, information technology, and the interconnectedness of systems. 
Its evolution reflects the merging of technological advancements, linguistic adaptations, and cultural influences over time.
