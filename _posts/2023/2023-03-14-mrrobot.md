> Can you root this Mr. Robot styled machine? This is a virtual machine meant for beginners/intermediate users. There are 3 hidden keys located on the machine, can you find them?

[Mr. Robot CTF - TryHackMe Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot)

### What is key 1?

First of all, start with a port scan: `sudo nmap -sV 10.10.157.176`

- Open ports
```
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd
```

Use `gobuster` for folder/file enumeration: `gobuster dir -u https://10.10.157.176 -k -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt`

In the following path `https://10.10.157.176/robots.txt` we found this text:
```
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

Download `https://10.10.157.176/fsocity.dic` file.
And the first key is in `https://10.10.157.176/key-1-of-3.txt`.

### What is key 2?

Surfing to the website we find a login page: `https://10.10.157.176/wp-login.php`. 
At the beginning of `fsocity.dic` there are some potentially usernames (mrrobot, Robot, Elliot).
I tried `Elliot` in the *fogot password* page `https://10.10.157.176/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword` and I received confirm of the correct username.

Use `wpscan` to perform a dictionary attack on login page.

`wpscan --disable-tls-checks --url https://10.10.157.176/wp-login.php -U Elliot -P /home/yami/Desktop/thm/fsocity.dic`

It will take a long time to find the correct password, because it is at the end of the wordlist of more than 800000 words.
Password is *ER28–0652*.

Now we have credentials to enter in the wordpress management page.

We are admin so we can upload a [reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) inside *Appearance --> Editor --> 404.php*.

On local machine use `nc -nvlp 9000` and execute via browser *https://ip-address/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php*.

When we will be inside, we'll land such as *daemon* user. 

There is a chance to make the present shell more stable by using Python’s Pty module:

Go to `/home/robot/`.

![Alt text](/assets/img/mrrobot/1.png.png)

![Alt text](/assets/img/mrrobot/2.png.png)

We have to crack md5 hash to find *robot*'s password.
Use *John The Ripper*.

![Alt text](/assets/img/mrrobot/3.png.png)

Now we have user password to catch the second key.

![Alt text](/assets/img/mrrobot/4.png.png)

### What is key 3?

Now we have to perform privilege escalation.
We have to find some vulnerabilities in the kernel or in some files.

*For privilege escalation we can use either LinPEAS or LinEnum tools which will identify potential vectors for PE in the target server. In order to scan the system, we’ll need to transfer one of the scripts to the victim machine. For this purpose we can use SimpleHTTPServer Python module.*

But we also can run the following command which searches for all files having **SUID** bit set: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

![Alt text](/assets/img/mrrobot/5.png.png)

TryHackMe hint suggested *nmap*. It is version 3.81 and it has an interactive mode in which nmap runs with "sudo" privileges. (https://vk9-sec.com/nmap-privilege-escalation/).

![Alt text](/assets/img/mrrobot/6.png.png)

We can find third key under `/root`.
