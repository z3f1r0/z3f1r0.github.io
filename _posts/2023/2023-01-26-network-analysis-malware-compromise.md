To complete this challenge is suggested the use of `Wireshark`{:.info}, `Tshark`{:.info} or `TCPDump`{:.info}.

## Scenario
A SOC Analyst at Umbrella Corporation is going through SIEM alerts and sees the alert for connections to a known malicious domain. The traffic is coming from Sara’s computer, an Accountant who receives a large volume of emails from customers daily. Looking at the email gateway logs for Sara’s mailbox there is nothing immediately suspicious, with emails coming from customers. Sara is contacted via her phone and she states a customer sent her an invoice that had a document with a macro, she opened the email and the program crashed. The SOC Team retrieved a PCAP for further analysis.

## Challenge Submission

### What’s the private IP of the infected host?

> **10.11.27.101**

I opened pcap file with Wireshark. 
The evidence of an high amount of packets trasferred from a particular endpoint is obvious.

*Wireshark* --> *Statistics* --> *Endpoint*

### What’s the malware binary that the macro document is trying to retrieve?

> **spet10.spr**

I Followed *TCP Stream* of infected host's suspicious packet which performed a *GET Request*.
We can see in the *TCP Stream* window that **spet10.spr** is a binary file. It starts with *MZ* characters, the initials for Mark Zbikowski, one of the principal architects of MS-DOS and the Windows/DOS executable.

### From what domain HTTP requests with GET /images/ are coming from?

> **cochrimato.com**

To retrive this information I opened *File* --> *Export Objects* --> *HTTP...* and found HTTP domain where GET Request coming from.

### The SOC Team found Dridex, a follow-up malware from Ursnif infection, to be the culprit. The customer who sent her the macro file is compromised. What’s the full URL ending in .rar where Ursnif retrieves the follow-up malware from?

> **http://95.181.198.231/oiioiashdqbwe.rar**

I filtered by `http.content_type == "application/rar"`and I found it.

### What is the Dridex post-infection traffic IP addresses beginning with 185.?

> **185.244.150.230**

How we can see from the above image, there are two IP addresses beginning with 185.. The post-infection IP address we are searching is **185.244.150.230**.
