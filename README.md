# z3f1r0.github.io

Welcome — this is my personal blog and projects site.  
Here I keep a partial collection of notes, personal thoughts and projects related to digital forensics, incident response, blue-team and red-team exercises and general cybersecurity research.  
I also participate in practical labs and challenges on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/z3f1r0) and [Blue Team Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online/public/user/d80a8e43499452fa0bd09b).

## About this repo
This repository hosts the source code for my GitHub Pages site: **https://z3f1r0.github.io**.  
The site contains:

- A collection of personal notes and technical write-ups.  
- Write-ups and investigations from CTFs, blue-team challenges and pentest practice.
- Small web tools and client-side projects. 

It is intentionally a partial collection — some notes are private or experimental drafts, others are quick knowledge snapshots.

## Selected projects
- [**ETHQuery**](https://github.com/z3f1r0/ETHQuery) — a small client-side web app for exploring Ethereum transactions via the Alchemy API.  
- Various DFIR, network and malware analysis notes.
- Practical write-ups covering blue-team incident investigations and penetration testing exercises.
