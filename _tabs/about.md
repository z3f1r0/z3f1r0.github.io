<cite>Like the west wind, I haven't yet understood whether I should be like a gentle breeze or a mighty storm.</cite> 
<br><br>

My name is Peter and <i>z3f1r0</i> is the nickname I use in the cyberspace. It refers to the Greek God of the west wind which blows like a sweet breeze in spring but become like a mighty storm in winter.
I used this metaphor to describe philosophically my natural fluctuation in the real life such as in my job: I often study network security techniques to defend computer systems but I also like discover new types of vulnerabilities and offensive security techniques.
<br><br>

I work in cybersecurity and am passionate about both red and blue team activities.
<br>
This is a personal space where I can keep my notes and express my interests.
