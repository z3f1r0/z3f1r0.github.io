<br>
My name is Peter. <b>z3f1r0</b> is the nickname I use in Internet and it refers to the Greek God of the West wind which blows like a sweet breeze in spring but became like a mighty storm in winter. <br>
I used this metaphor to indicate my nature’s oscillation in the real life like in my work: I often study network security techniques to defend computers systems but I also like discover 
new types of vulnerabilities and offensive techniques in people and systems. <br>
I work in cybersecurity and am passionate about both red and blue team activities.<br>
This is a personal space where I can keep my notes and express my interests. <br><br>
